# Rajasthan IT DAY <HACK/ATHON>

## üî• Inspiration

Missing medical reports can have a significant impact on patients care in hospitals. When healthcare providers do not have access to patient's complete medical history, they may not be able to make accurate diagnoses, provide appropriate treatment, or make informed decisions about patient's care.

Our inspiration behind this initiative is to improve the quality of healthcare services and make them more accessible and efficient. By digitalizing medical records, healthcare providers can access patient information quickly and easily, which can help them make better informed decisions. Moreover, creating a centralized database can help government agencies to better understand and monitor the health conditions of population. This can ultemately lead to bettter health outcomes and reduce the risk of life-threatening situations.

## ‚ùì What it does
This application provides a platform for patients to view their previous diagnosis, medications, laboratory tests, previous hospital stays, living wills and even organ donations.

Doctors can acceess the medical records of the patients assigned to them including their appointments, laboratory test results,, and electronic consultations.

Hospitals will have a platform to manage the patients, they can assign patients to specific doctor in that hospital and update the medical reports of every individual patient while checking out. For reports that are available as a hard copy, this platform provides a scanner which can read any kind of medical reciept and extract the required information

## üõ† How we built it
**User Interface:** Material UI by Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, SCSS

**Backend:** Django Framework (Python)

**Database:** SQLite

**API:** Huggingface

**For OCR (Optical Charecter Recognition):** disreact-optical character recognization, pytesseract, huggingfacee-distilbert model

## ü¶æ Challenges we ran into
- We faced difficulty in getting the data from the API as the data in medical reciepts is unreliable
- As working with team, we faced merge conflicts while in the middle of the project
- Integration of Frontend with Backend was a challenging task as we had to sync with database

## üê±‚Äçüèç Accomplishments that we're proud of
By digitalizing medical records, patients and healthcae providers can access patient information quickly and easily, regardless of location. This can improve the quality of care provided to patients and reduce risk of errors.


## üìë What we learned
- **Adaptability:** During this hackathon we encoutered unexpected challenges which made us to pivot our appplication to meet the time constraint
- **Time Management:** We were able to prioritize tasks.
- **Collaboration:** As working in a team of five, we learned to divide the tasks and work collaborattively using git.

## üì¢ What's next for E-Med
A centralized database of medical records can provide valuabler data that can be used fo research and data analytics, this can help to identify trends and patterns in healthcare, which can be used to develop new treatments and improve patient care.
